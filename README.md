Sometimes it seems like every year brings a new disease to fret about. Swine flu, Bird flu, Classic scurvy, etc.

I have a theory that there is a secret department in the CDC that is coming up with random yet catchy names for new diseases. Similar to how The Weather Channel names storms so that they fit with the annual marketing campaign.

Well, it's time we the people had the tools to name diseases too! So here you go, world, your very own random disease name generator.
